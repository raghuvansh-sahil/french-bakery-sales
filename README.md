# 🥐 Time Series Forecasting Project: French Bakery Sales


This project explores **Time Series Forecasting** techniques using daily sales data from a French bakery.  
The goal is to predict sales volumes for multiple bakery products while understanding the core concepts behind time series forecasting.  

I built this project as part of my journey to **learn and understand time series analysis** — covering everything from **baseline models** to **ARIMA/SARIMA**, **cross-validation**, **exogenous features**, **prediction intervals**, and **model evaluation metrics**.
